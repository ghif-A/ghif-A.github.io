## Experience
**Machine Learning Cohort @ Bangkit Academy (Feb 2023 - Jul 2023)**
- Bangkit is a Google-led learning program with the support of GoTo, Traveloka, and DeepTech
Foundation, in partnership with Kampus Merdeka. The program offers a learning space for Indonesian

specializations in key concepts and applications of AI to solve a wide range of ML problems.

**Machine Learning Engineer Intern @ Fishku Indonesia (May 2023 - Jun 2023)**
- I'm leading a team of 8 members to work on a company-based capstone project for Bangkit Academy.
- The project aims to improve Fishku, an e-commerce platform that connects fish buyers and sellers.
